**Podcasts I enjoy:**

[Talk Python to me](https://talkpython.fm/) - Deep dives on python topics with interesting people who are working it. This is my go to python podcast.

[Command line heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes) - By RedHat. Best history lessons in under a half hour. Season 3 was about programming languages. The previous seasons had episodes on the origin of DevOps, Agile, OS wars etc.
